    "The project involves using a regenerative simulation method to determine the optimal staffing level in a call center to meet specified performance constraints with 95% confidence. Here is a detailed breakdown of the project parameters and requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "- Call centers have seen a surge in growth and spend over $300 billion worldwide.\n",
    "- The challenge lies in balancing operational efficiency and service quality.\n",
    "- Personnel costs make up about 70% of a call centerâ€™s expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call Center Staffing Aspects\n",
    "- The right number of agents is crucial to avoid understaffing, which can lead to poor service and customer frustration.\n",
    "- A study by Purdue University indicates that 63% of customers cite a negative call center experience as a reason for stopping transactions with a company.\n",
    "- The model must consider customer abandonment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call Center Model\n",
    "- A moderate-sized call center with an average of 20 arrivals per minute over a given time interval is considered.\n",
    "- The average service time per call is three minutes ($\\mu = \\frac{1}{3}$).\n",
    "- Arrivals are according to a Poisson process, and service times are exponentially distributed.\n",
    "- The call center operates on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) basis.\n",
    "- Each inbound caller has a generally distributed patience time $ T $. If the wait time exceeds $ T $, the caller abandons the call; otherwise, they get served.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Quality of Service\n",
    "- The probability of abandonment should be less than 2%.\n",
    "- The average wait should be less than five seconds.\n",
    "- It is advised to choose more than $\\lambda / \\mu = 60$ agents to meet these constraints, but the exact number needed is unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Description\n",
    "- Use regenerative simulation output analysis to identify the minimum number of call center agents needed to meet the target performance constraint with 95% confidence.\n",
    "- Assume customer patience times are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniformly over the interval [0,6] minutes.\n",
    "- Determine the minimum staffing levels that meet both target performance constraints i) and ii) with 95% confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the project's aim is to apply simulation techniques to find the least number of call center agents required to ensure that the probability of a customer abandoning a call is below 2%, and the average waiting time is under five seconds. This will involve modeling the call center's traffic as a Poisson process with exponentially distributed service times and uniformly distributed patience times, and then simulating different staffing levels to find the optimal number of agents that satisfies the service level constraints with high confidence."
